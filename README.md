# IMBD-Movie-rating
This is the data analysis project using pandas in python on the movie rating.
We have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from year 2010 to 2016 along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this project, we will try to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters.

The modules/libraries used in this are:
1.Pandas 
2.Matplotlib.pyplot
3.Seaborn
4.Numpy
